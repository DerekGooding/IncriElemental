# AGENTIC_TEST.md - Agentic Piloting Template

Use this template to ask me (Gemini) to perform a "Headless" test or balance simulation of **IncriElemental**.

## Test Scenario
Describe the scenario to be tested. (e.g., "Manifest 5 specks and simulate 60 seconds of passive Earth gathering.")

## Initial State
- **Start from:** (e.g., New Game, specific JSON file, or current state)

## Actions to Perform
1.  (e.g., Focus 15 times)
2.  (e.g., Manifest:speck)
3.  (e.g., Update:60s)

## Expected Outcome
What should the `GameState` look like after the actions? (e.g., "Earth should be at least 6.0")

## Verification Strategy
- [ ] Check for resource bottlenecks.
- [ ] Verify discovery triggers.
- [ ] Export `GameState` JSON for review.

---
*I will run this scenario in "Headless" mode and report back with a state analysis.*
