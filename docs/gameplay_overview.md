# GAMEPLAY_OVERVIEW.md - The Wizard's Journey

This document outlines the end-to-end user experience of **IncriElemental**, from the first "Focus" to the final "Ascension."

---

## Phase 1: The Awakening (0-2 Minutes)
The player begins in a pitch-black void with a single purple button: **FOCUS**.

1.  **Manual Focus:** Each click generates **1.0 Aether**.
2.  **Observation:** At **10 Aether**, the log notes: *"The void feels thick with potential."*
3.  **The First Matter:** Manifesting a **SPECK** (Cost: 10 Aether) creates the first passive resource: **1.0 Earth/sec**.
4.  **Early Automation:** Manifesting the **RUNE OF ATTRACTION** (Cost: 30 Aether) automates the manual focus, generating **2.0 Aether/sec** passively.

## Phase 2: Elemental Expansion (2-8 Minutes)
The player begins to define the laws of physics by manifesting the core elements.

1.  **Ignition:** Manifesting a **SPARK** (Cost: 50 Aether, 50 Earth) unlocks **Fire Essence**.
2.  **Condensation:** Manifesting a **DROPLET** (Cost: 100 Aether, 50 Fire) unlocks **Water Essence**.
3.  **Expansion:** Manifesting a **BREEZE** (Cost: 200 Aether, 50 Water) unlocks **Air Essence**.
4.  **The Altar:** Constructing the **ALTAR** (Cost: 100 Aether, 20 Earth) provides a massive storage boost (+1000 Max) to all essences, preventing early-game caps.

## Phase 3: Industrialization & Exploration (8-15 Minutes)
With the elements unlocked, the player builds structures and explores the manifested reality.

1.  **The Forge:** Manifesting the **FORGE** (Cost: 50 Fire, 100 Earth) is a prerequisite for advanced tools and structures.
2.  **Tools of the Craft:**
    - **PICKAXE:** Increases manual Focus power by +2.0.
    - **FOCUS CRYSTAL:** Increases passive Aether generation by +5.0/sec.
3.  **Mass Generation:**
    - **WELLS:** Generate +5.0 Water/sec.
    - **BRAZIERS:** Generate +5.0 Fire/sec.
4.  **Life & Familiars:**
    - **GARDENS:** Generate **Life Essence** (+2.0/sec).
    - **FAMILIARS:** Entities that generate Aether (+20/sec) and Earth (+10/sec). They also unlock the **World Map**.
5.  **Exploration:** The player clicks on the grid-based map to send Familiars. Exploring costs **500 Aether** and reveals terrain (Plains, Mountains, Oceans, Ruins) with instant resource rewards and Lore fragments.

## Phase 4: The Great Spire (15-20 Minutes)
The end-game goal is to construct a monument that pierces the void.

1.  **FOUNDATION:** (Cost: 1000 Earth, 200 Life). The base of the Spire appears in the center of the screen.
2.  **SHAFT:** (Cost: 2000 Fire, 1000 Air). The Spire grows taller.
3.  **CORE:** (Cost: 5000 Aether, 3000 Water). The Spire begins to pulse with golden light.
4.  **ASCEND:** A large golden button appears. Clicking it triggers the victory sequence and credits.

## Phase 5: New Game+ (Post-Ascension)
After the credits, the player can choose **"A NEW AWAKENING."**

1.  **Cosmic Insight:** All resource gains (manual and passive) are multiplied by **1.5x** (and an additional +0.5x for every subsequent Ascension).
2.  **Void Infusion:** A new manifestation appears in the shop.
    - **VOID INFUSION:** (Cost: 5000 Aether). Permanently increases the storage capacity of all elements by +5000. This allows for deep scaling in the second incarnation.
