## 🤖 Agentic Improvement Mandate
When requested to perform a project review or suggest new improvements, I (the AI Agent) should:
1.  **Analyze the Codebase:** Search for technical debt, monoliths, or areas where modularity could be improved.
2.  **Evaluate Gameplay:** Use the balance simulator and current manifestation data to identify potential bottlenecks or flat spots in the progression.
3.  **Propose Innovations:** Draft new mechanics, narrative arcs, or agentic automation features that align with the core mandates in `GEMINI.md`.
4.  **Update this Document:** Document the findings and proposed solutions here before they are promoted to the `roadmap.md`.
